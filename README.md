# Game-of-Life
Implements an object oriented approach to Conway's Game of Life. It should prompt you in the command line for several different ways to view the progression of the game as well as other factors your can modify. Everything should be fairly straightforward if you're looking to modify the code.

Above I have included both the source code and necessary project file for eclipse if you want to view the code in eclipse and the jar file for easy use otherwise.
